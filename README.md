# Solar System Simulator

## This is a play project by me to simulate our current solar system

The model used in this is a Kepler model, I tried to create a newtonian model, but it didn't work and was too hard :(

## How to run
Create a venv [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) _or_ install the packages globally. <br/>
Run the following command 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If that gives an error try this instead
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
